# TimeSeriesProject
  
Make sure you have enough observations in the dataset to separate them into train and test to generate 
efficient plots. 
 
Your tasks for the project: 
a) Background of the data set.  
b) Use all but the last full cycle as your train dataset and keep last full cycle as your test dataset. Time 
sequence matters in time series data, so we don’t separate train and test randomly. 
c) Decompose the time series and describe the different components of the time series data 
d) Apply exponential smoothing, Holt Winters, and Time Series Regression approaches for 
forecasting for another year.  
e) Compare and measure the accuracy of forecasting using MAPE, MAD and RMSE 
 
It is important that you start the project early, so that you can choose a good data set with good 
variables to work with.  
 
Groups: You may stay with the same group as before.    
 
Software: You are required to use R for statistical analysis. Any word processing software to generate 
the repot.    
Submission:  You  are  required  to  submit  a  word  processed  report.  The  report  should  look  like  a  
standard report with a title, table of contents, etc.   
Place your graphs/charts/summaries within detailed discussions to improve the flow of the report.  
Label graphs/charts/tables then it will be easy to refer when you describe them. Those increase the 
quality of the report as well.  
 
Due Date: This project is due before the class on 10th December. There will be a canvas link expiring 
at 10.55am on 10th December.

Important:   
• You are required to justify any methods or statistics you are using in this project. 
• All the graphical and numerical descriptions should accompany detailed interpretations of them. 
• Your grade is mostly based on your analysis and justifications and interpretations. 
• Need to include all the appropriate R outputs to show your work. Do not include R 
code/commands. 
 
Grading criteria: 
1. Word processed report (40 points) 
a.  Background of the dataset and motivation for variable selection – 5 points 
b.  Describing components – 10 points 
c.  Apply  exponential  smoothing,  Holt  Winters  and  Regression  Approach  for  forecasting  for  
another year (or several months/weeks) & Compare and measure the accuracy of forecasting 
– 20 points 
d.  Quality and organization of the report – 5 points 
 
Individual Contribution to the project (peer evaluations) – Your grade for this project is based on the 
percentage  of  your  contribution  to  the  project.  Each  member  is  expected  to  know  the  work  of  the 
entire project. Your project score will be based on your contribution to both the project and the group. 
Contribution includes, but not limited to, the work you have done, how much support you have given 
to the other members, how well your communicated with the members, whether you have been an 
encouraging group member, whether you have asked help from the other members, etc. Check the 
‘Group Partner Evaluation’ for more details.
